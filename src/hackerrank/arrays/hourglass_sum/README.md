# 2D Array - DS

Given a 6 x 6 2D array `arr`. 
An hourglass is a subset of values with indices falling in this pattern in `arr`'s graphical representation:

```
a b c
  d
e f g
```

There are 16 hourglasses in `arr`. An hourglass sum is the sum of an hourglass' values. Calculate the hourglass sum for every hourglass in `arr`, then print the maximum hourglass sum. The array will always be 6 x 6
