# Left Rotation
A left rotation operation on an array shifts each of the array's elements 1 unit to the left.
For example, if 2 left rotations are performed on array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then the array would become
`[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`. Note that the lowest index item moves to the highest index in a rotation.
This is called a circular array.
